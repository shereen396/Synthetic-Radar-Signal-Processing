**Radar & Navigation Signal Enhancement**

Simulates radar-like signals inspired by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and applies wavelet denoising and Kalman filtering to improve signal quality. Demonstrates practical signal processing algorithms for radar, navigation, and remote sensing.

 **Features**

1. Multi-target SAR-like signals with Gaussian noise

2. Wavelet Transform and Kalman Filter for signal enhancement

3. Computes SNR, MSE, PSNR

4. Generates plots: Clean, Noisy, Wavelet-denoised, Kalman-filtered signals, and SNR comparison

**How to Run**
1. download the repository files and save them in the same folder
2. Open the project in MATLAB
3. Run `analyze_results`
All plots and metrics will be generated automatically.
